# skills-lab

A VR training simulation for students with a major in nursing.<br>
The students will practice working with a complicated VANAS shelf where they can get the right dose of medicine for the patient. <br>
This VR project will be used in a HTC Vive headset.

## Preparation
Using:
* Cinema4D and Blender
* Unity3D
* Trello for Scrum (https://trello.com/skillslab2)
* Github with command line
* HTC Vive

## Controller application ideas
* Laser beam coming from controller which can 'grab' objects
* Colorwheel/wheel on controller touch pad. 
* Digital hand which is controlled using the controller buttons etc. (example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEKn_COI-GQ)
* Give buzz feedback to make friction seem more realistic (e.g. with a bow and arrow)
* Stylus in hand to use on touch screen
